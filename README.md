This script takes MaxQuant evidence.txt file with ADPr sites and the matching fasta file to extract localization scores and filter them to only retain high-quality sites.
It also annotates the site within the Uniprot ID, and transfers MBR intensities for modified peptides within groups if they were detected by MS/MS.
